# Kiito – Intelligent Academic Assistant

Kiito differs significantly from standard academic utilities by prioritizing **privacy, local-first data ownership, and seamless user experience**. It serves as a sophisticated frontend for your academic life, bridging the gap between legacy university portals (SAP) and modern mobile standards.

> [!NOTE]
> **Privacy Architecture**: Kito operates on a zero-knowledge principle regarding your credentials. All sensitive data is processed locally on your device or transmitted directly to the university portal via a secure, transient link. No intermediary servers store your login information.

## 🏗️ Architectural Excellence

Kiito is built on a robust, scalable foundation designed for reliability and maintainability.

### **Core Architecture: Clean Architecture + MVVM**
The application strictly adheres to **Clean Architecture** principles, separating concerns into three distinct layers:
*   **Presentation Layer**: Built with **Jetpack Compose** (Material 3), utilizing **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** for reactive state management. UI events are decoupled from business logic, ensuring a responsive and crash-resistant interface.
*   **Domain Layer**: Contains pure Kotlin business logic and use cases (e.g., `AppSyncUseCase`, `GetAttendanceSummaryUseCase`). This layer is platform-agnostic and shared across all targets via Kotlin Multiplatform.
*   **Data Layer**: Manages data sources through the **Repository Pattern**. It arbitrates between the local database (Room), **DataStore Preferences** (Key-Value storage), and network data sources.

### **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**
The project is built on **Kotlin Multiplatform**, with the core business logic shared across **Android**, **iOS**, and **Desktop** targets from a single `commonMain` source set. Platform-specific code (notifications, secure storage, connectivity) is isolated via `expect/actual` declarations.

## 🚀 Key Features & Engineering Highlights

### 1. **Secure Direct-Link Integration (SAP)**
Instead of relying on unstable APIs, Kiito implements a custom **Secure Direct-Link** engine.
*   **Mechanism**: The app establishes a direct, encrypted session with the university's SAP portal.
*   **Optimization**: Advanced parsing algorithms transform raw portal data into structured, queryable local objects in milliseconds.
*   **Security**: Authentication tokens are handled in-memory and discarded post-session.

### 2. **Offline-First & Local Persistence**
Kiito treats the local device as the source of truth.
*   **Room Database**: Complex relational data (Students, Sections, Attendance) is stored in a normalized SQL database using **Room**. This allows for complex queries, such as "attendance trends over time" or "subjects with low attendance," to be executed instantly without network calls.
*   **Proto DataStore**: User preferences and session configurations are strictly typed and stored using **Protocol Buffers**, ensuring type safety and modifying settings without UI jank.
*   **DataStore Preferences**: Utilized for lightweight key-value storage of application state, flags, and simple user settings. Also serves as the encrypted storage backend on Android — credentials are encrypted with **Google Tink (AES-256-GCM)** before being written, with the master key protected by the **Android Keystore**. `EncryptedSharedPreferences` has been deprecated and removed in favour of this approach. On iOS, sensitive values are stored in the **Apple Keychain**.

### 3. **Intelligent Background Synchronization**
*   **WorkManager Integration**: The app employs Android's **WorkManager** exclusively for reliable, deferrable background tasks such as widget updates.
*   **Smart Scheduling**: Sync jobs are optimized to run only when network conditions are favorable, conserving battery while keeping attendance data up-to-date.
*   **AlarmManager**: utilized strictly for precise notification delivery.
*   **Notification Pipeline**: A custom notification controller manages alerts for upcoming classes and attendance thresholds.

### 4. **Comprehensive Academic Suite**
Kiito goes beyond attendance to manage your entire academic life:
*   **Smart Calendar**: Integrated academic calendar view.
*   **Exam Central**: dedicated section for upcoming exam schedules and seating arrangements.
*   **Faculty Directory**: detailed faculty search and information system.

### 5. **User-Centric Customization**
*   **Attendance Targets**: Set your own required attendance threshold (e.g., 75%) and get personalized alerts when you drop below it.
*   **Profile Management**: Easily manage your student profile details.
*   **Feedback System**: Direct in-app support channel.
*   **Seamless Updates**: Integrated Google Play In-App Updates ensure you're always running the latest version with the newest features and security patches.

### 6. **Supabase Integration (Static Data)**
*   **Hybrid Data Model**: While sensitive user data comes from SAP, static academic data (Faculty details, Holiday lists) is fetched from **Supabase**. This hybrid approach ensures the app remains lightweight while providing rich contextual information.

### 7. **Modern UI/UX with Jetpack Compose**
*   **Declarative UI**: 100% Kotlin-based UI definition.
*   **Rich Animations**: Integrated **Lottie** animations for a delightful and interactive user experience.
*   **Haze & Glassmorphism**: Utilizes the **Haze** library for high-performance, real-time blurring effects (frosted glass) on dialogs and overlays.
*   **Glance Widgets**: Home screen widgets are exclusively built using **Jetpack Glance**, allowing users to view their schedule without opening the app in a performant, battery-efficient manner.

## ⚙️ Setup & Build Instructions

This project uses the Gradle build system and is configured for Android Studio Meerkat or newer.

### Prerequisites
*   Android Studio Meerkat+
*   JDK 17
*   Kotlin 2.3+

---

### 🔑 Required Secrets Configuration

The build system reads all sensitive credentials from **`local.properties`** (Android) and **`Secrets.xcconfig`** (iOS). These files are **gitignored** and must be created manually on every development machine.

- **Android** — create `local.properties` in the project root and add the required secret keys. Android Studio will auto-populate `sdk.dir`; the remaining keys must be filled in manually.
- **iOS** — copy `iosApp/Configuration/Secrets.xcconfig.template` to `iosApp/Configuration/Secrets.xcconfig` and fill in your values.



### Building the Project

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kito.git
    cd kito
    ```

2.  **Configure secrets** as described above — create `local.properties` in the root and copy `Secrets.xcconfig.template` → `Secrets.xcconfig` for iOS.

3.  **Build the Android APK**:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew assembleDebug
    ```

4.  **Open iOS project** in Xcode (`iosApp/iosApp.xcworkspace`) and run on simulator or device.

5.  **Run Tests**:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew :composeApp:desktopTest
    ```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy Manifesto

Kiito is engineered with a **"Trust No One"** architecture.

*   **No Commercial Tracking**: We do not use Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, or any third-party behavioral trackers.
*   **Ephemeral Credentials**: Your password is never written to disk in plaintext. It is encrypted before storage and the encryption key never leaves the secure hardware.
*   **Sandboxed Storage**: All local data is stored in the app's private sandbox, inaccessible to other applications without root access.

### Credential Security

**Android — AES-256-GCM + Android Keystore**

Sensitive values (SAP password) are encrypted using **AES-256-GCM** via [Google Tink](https://github.com/google/tink) before being written to DataStore Preferences. The encryption key itself is stored inside the **Android Keystore** — a hardware-backed secure enclave that never exposes the raw key material to application code. Even if the DataStore file is extracted from the device, the ciphertext is unreadable without the Keystore-bound key.

AES-256-GCM provides both **confidentiality** (256-bit key, computationally infeasible to brute-force) and **integrity** (the GCM authentication tag detects any tampering with the ciphertext). `EncryptedSharedPreferences` was deprecated and has been removed — this approach supersedes it.

**iOS — Apple Keychain (Security framework)**

On iOS, sensitive values are stored directly in the **Apple Keychain** using the native Security framework (`SecItemAdd` / `SecItemCopyMatching`, `kSecClassGenericPassword`). The Keychain is encrypted by the OS using the device passcode and, on devices with a Secure Enclave, keys are hardware-bound. Data is automatically wiped if the device is restored, and is inaccessible to other apps by default due to iOS sandbox enforcement.
